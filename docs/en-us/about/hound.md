# About Hound
Hound Demo is a technological demo and prototyping effort to demonstrate the
possibility of integrating Google Forms with independent frontend technology.

It was inspired by Selangor state of Malaysia where they use the same level
of technological understanding to track individuals interacted locations during
Covid19 pandemic. Then, one of our client persuaded us to prototype such data
harvester technology.

Hound however, targets a more generic use of Google Drive integrations, allowing
customers to gather and visualize data without needing a custom tools.



## Why Develop Hound
There are a lot of compelling reasons for us to develop Hound technologies.



### Friendly Visualization and Backend
The backend for Hound can be either custom REST API server or **Google Drive**
products. With Google Drive integration, we can quickly prototype frontend
technologies without needing to mess with backend server.

Also, thanks to the automation that generates Google Sheet data, customers can
easily shard the datasheet, export the Google Sheet into multiple user-friendly
format **with needing a technical person**. In fact, customers can build charts
and view the data in near real-time using the Google Sheet alone.




### Low Cost Data Harvester
With **Google Drive** acting as the backend, the only cost we can see is the
[GSuite](https://gsuite.google.com/) membership. That is **very low cost**
solution considering it facilitates customers with self-service visualization
and export tools, international security level grade products, and easily
shardable backend "database".




### Customizable User Interface
With the ability to develop the data submission off Google Forms, Hound can
customize its own form according to frontend designers like adding animations,
graphic interactions and etc. This is useful when one needs a sophisicated
user-interface design working directly with Google Drive products.



### Multiple Points-of-Failures Considered
Hound took in "multiple points-of-failures" as a design factor. This includes
working properly when certain technologies are unavailable like the backend
server, disabled Javascript scenario, etc. That way, we know Hound will work
properly in various harsh environments.




### Avoid Vendor-Locking
Hound managed to isolate itself from any backend including **Google Drive**.
Thus, it avoided vendor-locking to a particular backend service, allowing the
frontend developer to easily switch between the service providers.



### Compatible with Cloud Computing and Edge Computing
As the data privacy awareness are getting crucial, Hound is designed to be
compatible with cloud computing and edge computing. This means Hound can operate
locally and over the Internet form.




## Where To Deploy Hound
At this moment, we believe Hound can be deployed into the following use-cases.


### Human-Interacted Input Web Application
Like any data harvester, Hound can be easily deployed as one of the human input
form to collect a certain amount of information. This allows manual input from
individuals.



### Internet of Things Data Input Terminal
Another use-case we **strongly** want Hound to be in is to act as
Internet-of-Things (IoT) data terminal. This allows both the sensors and human
interactions to the backend service without complicating the backend servers.




## Want to Collaborate
At this point, Hound is not ready to be released as a ZORALab full-fletch
production product. However, if you're interested to collaborate with us to
