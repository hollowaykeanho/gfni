# GFNI
Google Forms Native Integration (GFNI) is a technological demo and prototyping
effort to demonstrate the possibility of integrating Google Forms with an
independent frontend technology.

It was inspired by Selangor state of Malaysia where they use the same level
of technological understanding to track individuals interacted locations during
Covid19 pandemic.

GFNI however, targets a more generic use of Google Drive integrations, allowing
customers to gather and visualize data without needing a custom tools.
