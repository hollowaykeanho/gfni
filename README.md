# Hound Demo
Hound Demo is a technological demo and prototyping effort to demonstrate the
possibility of integrating Google Forms with independent frontend technology.

It was inspired by Selangor state of Malaysia where they use the same level
of technological understanding to track individuals interacted locations during
Covid19 pandemic.

Hound however, targets a more generic use of Google Drive integrations, allowing
customers to gather and visualize data without needing a custom tools.
